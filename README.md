## Aim ##
My aim for this project is to create and build my very own version of a Jimi Hendrix tribute webpage for old fans and new fans alike. 

For medium and large sized devices, this webpage also accounts the facts surrounding the recording of one of Hendrix's most famous albums 'Are You Experienced?' and the effects after the album is released.

This fan page will include a bio, testimonial, video and news sections to give the user some introductory information of the artiste.

## Wireframes ##
I created wireframes by hand for the mobile-first approach and then went on to medium and larger screens. 

The wireframes can be view via this [link](assests/wireframes).

## UX ## 
My design for this webpage is a minimalistic approach of a black and grey theme with simple but elegant features. I want to display some interesting information about my favourite artiste and have a section for some of my other favorite artistes sharing about how Jimi Hendrix had influenced them and their music. 

I used many black and white photos with just a few coloured ones to give this webpage some contrast. I want to achieve producing a webpage that is aesthetically pleasing and also easy to navigate around, with photos and videos which I personally love and picked out.

## User Stories ##
Below are some user stories that I want to achieve:
1. I want a modern, clean looking and responsive webpage filled with information of his life
2. Jimi Hendrix is a legend in my books and I want to share his musical genius to the world through pictures and videos of him
3. I want everyone to know how influential he was in shaping the music careers of many future musicians through their testimonies of him
4. For medium and large screens, I want to include an introduction of the story behind one of his greatest albums 'Are You Experienced?' and feature the shows that are produced based on this album
5. I want users to be able to find more news about Hendrix from the social media sites in the footer
