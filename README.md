## Aim ##
My aim for this project is to create and build my very own version of a Jimi Hendrix tribute webpage for old fans and new fans alike. 

For medium and large sized devices, this webpage also accounts the facts surrounding the recording of one of Hendrix's most famous albums 'Are You Experienced?' and the effects after the album is released.

This fan page will include a bio, testimonial, video and news sections to give the user some introductory information of the artiste.
