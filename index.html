    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">Born in 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi Hendrix learned to play guitar as a teenager and
        grew up to become
        a rock legend who excited audiences in the 1960s with his innovative electric guitar playing. One of his most
        memorable performances was at Woodstock in 1969, where he performed "The Star Spangled Banner." Hendrix died
        in 1970 from drug-related complications, leaving his mark on the world of rock music and remaining popular to
        this day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="bio-no-show d-none d-md-block">
      <h4>Early Years</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix (later changed by his father to James Marshall) on
          November 27,
          1942, in Seattle, Washington. He had a difficult childhood, sometimes living in the care of relatives or
          acquaintances. His mother, Lucille, was only 17 years old when Hendrix was born. She had a stormy relationship
          with his
          father, Al, and eventually left the family after the couple had two more children together, sons Leon and
          Joseph. Hendrix would only see his mother sporadically before her death in 1958.</div>
      </div>
      <h4>Guitar</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">In many ways, music became a sanctuary for Hendrix. He was a fan of blues and rock and
          roll, and with his
          father's encouragement taught himself to play guitar.
          When Hendrix was 16, his father bought him his first acoustic guitar, and the next year his first electric
          guitar—a right-handed Supro Ozark that the natural lefty had to flip upside down to play. Shortly
          thereafter, he began performing with his band, the Rocking Kings. In 1959, he dropped out of high school and
          worked odd
          jobs while continuing to follow his musical aspirations. In 1961, Hendrix followed in his father's footsteps
          by enlisting in the United States Army. While training
          as a paratrooper, Hendrix still found time for music, forming a band named the King Kasuals. Hendrix served
          in
          the army until 1962, when he was honorably discharged after injuring himself during a parachute jump.
          After leaving the military, Hendrix began working under the name Jimmy James as a session musician, playing
          backup for such performers as Little Richard, B.B. King, Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers. In 1965 he also
          formed a group of his own called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which played gigs around New York City's
          Greenwich Village neighborhood.</div>
      </div>
      <h4>Jimi Hendrix Experience</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">In mid-1966, Hendrix met Chas Chandler—bass player of British rock group the Animals—who
          signed an
          agreement
          with Hendrix to become his manager. Chandler convinced Hendrix to go to London, where he joined forces with
          bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
          While performing in England, Hendrix built up quite a following among the country's rock royalty, with the
          Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and Eric Clapton all becoming great admirers of his work. One critic
          for the British music magazine Melody Maker said that he "had great stage presence" and looked at times as
          if he
          were playing "with no hands at all."</div>
      </div>
      <h4>Jimi Hendrix Hey Joe</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">Released in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, "Hey Joe," was an instant
          smash in Britain
          and
          was soon followed by hits such as "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary."
          On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967), Hendrix delighted audiences with his
          outrageous guitar playing skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over
          American music fans with his stunning performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix
          lighting his guitar on fire.</div>
      </div>
      <h4>Electric Ladyland</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">Quickly becoming a rock superstar, later that year Hendrix scored again with his second
          album, Axis: Bold
          as
          Love (1967). His final album as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Electric Ladyland (1968), featured the
          hit "All
          Along the Watchtower," which was written by Bob Dylan. The band continued to tour until it split up in 1969.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Star-Spangled Banner</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">In 1969, Hendrix performed at another legendary musical event: the Woodstock Festival.
          Hendrix, the last performer to appear in the three-day-plus festival, opened his set with a rock rendition
          of "The Star-Spangled Banner" that amazed the crowds and demonstrated his considerable talents as a
          musician.
          Also an accomplished songwriter and producer by this time, Hendrix had his own recording studio, Electric
          Lady, in which he worked with different performers to try out new songs and sounds.
          In late 1969, Hendrix put together a new group, forming Band of Gypsys with his army buddy Billy Cox and
          drummer Buddy Miles. The band never really took off, however, and Hendrix began working on a new album
          tentatively named First Rays of the New Rising Sun, with Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Sadly, Hendrix would not
          live to complete the project.</div>
      </div>
      <h4>How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">Hendrix died in London from drug-related complications on September 18, 1970, at the age
          of 27. He left
          an indelible mark on the world of rock music and remains popular to this day.
          As one journalist wrote in the Berkeley Tribe, "Jimi Hendrix could get more out of an electric guitar than
          anyone else. He was the ultimate guitar player."</div>

      One of the musicians often cited as the greatest guitarist to have ever lived, Jimi Hendrix is a man who needs no
      introduction. Most famous for his legendary performance of The Star Spangled Banner, his version of Bob Dylan’s
      All Along The
      Watchtower and his unfortunate death at the young age of 27, very few can equal the legacy of Hendrix. It may be
      hard to picture the shredder without his Strat slung over his shoulder (or without it burning apart in front of
      him), but this clip from 1967 film Experience will throw those premonitions out the door. Hendrix sat down for a
      single-take, five minute performance on an open-tuned 12 string, and it’s as hypnotising as you’d expect. <br>
      Here’s what Peter Neal, the filmmaker responsible for Experience, had to say about the jam:
      “Just before we left we asked Jimi if he would mind playing some acoustic blues. We’d decided to ask him to do
      that beforehand and since I had this 12-string guitar, I took it along thinking it would be more interesting for
      him than an ordinary 6 string.” “I noticed how Jimi kept looking at it and then he asked me if he could play it. I
      said that I’d hoped he would,
      so he picked it up and launched into that number. We didn’t have much film left at that point, and so I told him
      that he’d have to do it in one take but it was just one of those magic moments that happen sometimes.”

      ELECTRIC CHURCH tells the story of the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s involvement as the headliner of the Second
      Atlanta International Pop Festival, then hailed as the ‘Southern Woodstock'.
      Jimi Hendrix was the critical component he needed to elevate the three day festival to a major cultural event.
      ELECTRIC CHURCH features interviews with Hendrix’s Experience band mates Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell
      as well as Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, Rich Robinson, Kirk Hammett, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, and many
      others. His performance at the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival was not only significant on a musical
      level, but also in terms of socio-political dynamics. It was assumed that rural audiences would not take kindly to
      “long-hair” bands, and that black and white artists could not comfortably exist on the same bill; Atlanta Pop
      set out to challenge those beliefs.Hendrix’s music and message of universal love made him the ideal artist
      and, appropriately, was the first act booked for the festival. Footage has remained largely unseen until now.
