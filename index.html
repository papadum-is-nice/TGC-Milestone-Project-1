          James Marshall Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 - September 18, 1970) was an American
          rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter.
          Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential
          electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th
          century.
          The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock
          music"

          ELECTRIC CHURCH tells the story of the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s involvement as the headliner of the Second
          Atlanta International Pop Festival, then hailed as the ‘Southern Woodstock'.
          Jimi Hendrix was the critical component he needed to elevate the three day festival to a major cultural event.
          ELECTRIC CHURCH features interviews with Hendrix’s Experience band mates Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell
          as well as Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, Rich Robinson, Kirk Hammett, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, and many
          others.
          His performance at the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival was not only significant on a musical level,
          but also in terms of socio-political dynamics. It was assumed that rural audiences would not take kindly to
          “long-hair” bands, and that black and white artists could not comfortably exist on the same bill; Atlanta Pop
          set out to challenge those beliefs.
          Hendrix’s music and message of universal love made him the ideal artist and, appropriately, was the first act
          booked for the festival. Footage has remained largely unseen until now.

        <p class="card-text">I'm an Electric Ladyland guy. His music always sounds perfect to me, because he's bending
          sound, taking care of music in every dimension. Where most people think of it in two dimensions, he's thinking
          of it in four. I don't think there's a better guitar player in history. He's not something that can be
          improved on. And there's the spirit that goes into it. He creates a place where you can be high and hang out
          and lose yourself. He's bringing out aspects of sound we didn't know were there. I feel there are people
          moving ahead on that front, but they're not so much guitar players — like [electronic artists] Aphex Twin and
          Squarepusher. They continue the work Jimi Hendrix started, but not on the guitar."</p>
