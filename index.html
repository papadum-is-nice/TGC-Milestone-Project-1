        <h3>Biography</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">Born in 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi Hendrix learned to play guitar as a teenager
          and grew up to become a rock legend who excited audiences in the 1960s with his innovative electric guitar
          playing. One of his most memorable performances was at Woodstock in 1969, where he performed "The Star
          Spangled Banner." Hendrix died in 1970 from drug-related complications, leaving his mark on the world of rock
          music and remaining popular to this day.</div>

          <h4>Early Years</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix (later changed by his father to James Marshall)
            on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington. He had a difficult childhood, sometimes living in the care of
            relatives or acquaintances. His mother, Lucille, was only 17 years old when Hendrix was born. She had a
            stormy relationship with his father, Al, and eventually left the family after the couple had two more
            children together, sons Leon and Joseph. Hendrix would only see his mother sporadically before her death in
            1958.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Guitar</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">In many ways, music became a sanctuary for Hendrix. He was a fan of blues and rock and
            roll, and with his father's encouragement taught himself to play guitar. When Hendrix was 16, his father
            bought him his first acoustic guitar, and the next year his first electric guitar—a right-handed Supro Ozark
            that the natural lefty had to flip upside down to play. Shortly thereafter, he began performing with his
            band, the Rocking Kings. In 1959, he dropped out of high school and worked odd jobs while continuing to
            follow hismusical aspirations. In 1961, Hendrix followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the United States
            Army. While training as a paratrooper, Hendrix still found time for music, forming a band named the King Kasuals.
            Hendrix served in the army until 1962, when he was honorably discharged after injuring himself during a parachute
            jump. After leaving the military, Hendrix began working under the name Jimmy James as a session musician, playing
            backup for such performers as Little Richard, B.B. King, Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers. In 1965 he also
            formed a group of his own called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which played gigs around New York City's
            Greenwich Village neighborhood.</div>
        </div>

          <h4>Jimi Hendrix Experience</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">In mid-1966, Hendrix met Chas Chandler—bass player of British rock group the
            Animals—who signed an agreement with Hendrix to become his manager. Chandler convinced Hendrix to go to
            London, where he joined forces with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell to form the Jimi Hendrix
            Experience. While performing in England, Hendrix built up quite a following among the country's rock
            royalty, with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and Eric Clapton all becoming great admirers of his work. 
            One critic for the British music magazine Melody Maker said that he "had great stage presence" and looked at times 
            as if he were playing "with no hands at all."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Jimi Hendrix Hey Joe</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">Released in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, "Hey Joe," was an
            instant smash in Britain and was soon followed by hits such as "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary."
            On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967), Hendrix delighted audiences with his
            outrageous guitar playing skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over
            American music fans with his stunning performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix
            lighting his guitar on fire.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Electric Ladyland</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">Quickly becoming a rock superstar, later that year Hendrix scored again with his second
            album, Axis: Bold as Love (1967). His final album as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Electric Ladyland
            (1968), featured the hit "All Along the Watchtower," which was written by Bob Dylan. The band continued to
            tour until it split up in 1969.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Star-Spangled Banner</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">In 1969, Hendrix performed at another legendary musical event: the Woodstock Festival.
            Hendrix, the last performer to appear in the three-day-plus festival, opened his set with a rock rendition
            of "The Star-Spangled Banner" that amazed the crowds and demonstrated his considerable talents as a
            musician. Also an accomplished songwriter and producer by this time, Hendrix had his own recording studio,
            Electric Lady, in which he worked with different performers to try out new songs and sounds.
            In late 1969, Hendrix put together a new group, forming Band of Gypsys with his army buddy Billy Cox and
            drummer Buddy Miles. The band never really took off, however, and Hendrix began working on a new album
            tentatively named First Rays of the New Rising Sun, with Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Sadly, Hendrix would not
            live to complete the project.</div>

          <h4>How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">Hendrix died in London from drug-related complications on September 18, 1970, at the
            age of 27. He left an indelible mark on the world of rock music and remains popular to this day.
            As one journalist wrote in the Berkeley Tribe, "Jimi Hendrix could get more out of an electric guitar than
            anyone else. He was the ultimate guitar player."</div>

            that can be improved on. And there's the spirit that goes into it. He creates a place where you can be high 
            and hang outand lose yourself. He's bringing out aspects of sound we didn't know were there. I feel there are 
            people moving ahead on that front, but they're not so much guitar players — like [electronic artists] Aphex Twin

        <p>One of the musicians often cited as the greatest guitarist to have ever lived, Jimi Hendrix is a man who
          needs no introduction. Most famous for his legendary performance of The Star Spangled Banner, his version of
          Bob Dylan’s All Along The Watchtower and his unfortunate death at the young age of 27, very few can equal the
          legacy of Hendrix.

          <p class="ec-text-hide d-none d-md-block">It may be hard to picture the shredder without his Strat slung over
            his shoulder (or without it burning apart in front of him), but this clip from 1967 film Experience will
            throw those premonitions out the door. Hendrix sat down for a single-take, five minute performance on an
            open-tuned 12 string, and it’s as hypnotising as you’d expect.
            <br>
            Here’s what Peter Neal, the filmmaker responsible for Experience, had to say about the jam:
            “Just before we left we asked Jimi if he would mind playing some acoustic blues. We’d decided to ask him to
            do that beforehand and since I had this 12-string guitar, I took it along thinking it would be more
            interesting for him than an ordinary 6 string.” “I noticed how Jimi kept looking at it and then he asked me
            if he could play it. I said that I’d hoped he would, so he picked it up and launched into that number. We
            didn’t have much film left at that point, and so I told him that he’d have to do it in one take but it was 
            just one of those magic moments that happen sometimes.”</p>

      ELECTRIC CHURCH tells the story of the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s involvement as the headliner of the Second
      Atlanta International Pop Festival, then hailed as the ‘Southern Woodstock'.
      <p class="ec-text-hide d-none d-md-block">Jimi Hendrix was the critical component he needed to elevate the three
        day festival to a major cultural event. ELECTRIC CHURCH features interviews with Hendrix’s Experience band mates
        Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell as well as Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, Rich Robinson, Kirk Hammett,
        Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, and many others. His performance at the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival
        was not only significant on a musical level, but also in terms of socio-political dynamics. It was assumed that
        rural audiences would not take kindly to “long-hair” bands, and that black and white artists could not
        comfortably exist on the same bill; Atlanta Pop set out to challenge those beliefs.Hendrix’s music and message 
        of universal love made him the ideal artist and, appropriately, was the first act booked for the festival. 
        Footage has remained largely unseen until now.

        <p>1. The Jimi Hendrix Experience had only been together for a few weeks before recording.

          cover of Billy Roberts’ folk-rock standard “Hey Joe” with manager Chas Chandler producing. Released seven
          weeks later as a single, the recording – which would be included on the U.S. version of Are You Experienced –
          climbed all the way to Number Six on the U.K. charts, establishing Hendrix as a rising star in Britain and
          Europe. Incredibly, Hendrix had only just arrived in London on September 24th, hooked up with Redding on the
          29th, and auditioned Mitchell on October 4th; nine days after Mitchell joined the band, the Jimi Hendrix
          Experience played their first-ever gig at the Novelty cinema in Évreux, France, kicking off a four-date tour
          opening for French pop singer Johnny Hallyday.</p>

        <p>Given their recent formation, the “Hey Joe” session was a challenging one for the musicians, but it
          effectively
          set the sonic template for what would become Are You Experienced. “‘Hey Joe’ is a very difficult song to do
          right and it took forever,” Redding recalled in his autobiography, Are You Experienced. “The Marshalls were
          too
          much for the mikes and Chas and Jimi rowed over recording volume. That ‘loud,’ full, live sound was nearly
          impossible to obtain (especially for the bass) without the distortion, which funnily enough became part of our
          sound.”
        </p>

        <p>2. Despite its cohesive sound, Are You Experienced was actually recorded in bits and pieces over a five-month
          period. Perpetually strapped for cash, Chandler booked recording sessions for the Experience during brief
          breaks
          between live dates, though the band’s preference for recording at blistering volumes often made it difficult
          to
          secure studio time. “There was a bank above [De Lane Lea Studios],” Chandler told author John McDermott, “and
          it
          was at the time when computers were just coming in. Every time we went in, we would play so loud that it would
          foul up the computers upstairs. As a result, we would always have trouble getting in there when we wanted.”
        </p>

        <p>Ultimately, with “Hey Joe” surging up the U.K. charts, Chandler convinced Polydor (the parent company of
          Track
          Records) to open up an account in his name at Olympic Studios, where the band was able to complete the tracks
          for what would become Are You Experienced with the help of engineer Eddie Kramer. In all, though, it took 16
          different (and rather often rushed) sessions between October 23rd, 1966, and April 4th, 1967, to get
          everything
          in the can for the album.</p>

        <p>3. Mitch Mitchell was almost fired during the early stages of the album. With his swinging “lead drums”
          attack,
          Mitch Mitchell’s playing on Are You Experienced was nearly as much of a revelation for drummers as Hendrix’s
          was
          for guitarists. But in December 1966, his cavalier approach to real-life time-keeping almost got him sacked
          from
          the Experience. “He used to be late all the time,” Noel Redding recalled in Sean Egan’s Jimi Hendrix and the
          Making
          of Are You Experienced. “When times were tight, recording, Mitchell was always late.”</p>

        <p>When Mitchell blew off a December 15th session at London’s CBS Studios, Hendrix actually went so far as to
          offer the gig to former Merseybeats drummer John Banks. “Hendrix loved him,” Redding explained. “He wasn’t as
          flamboyant as Mitchell, but he fitted in well with what we were doing.” But when Banks declined the offer,
          citing his fear of flying, Hendrix and manager Chas Chandler decided to stick with Mitchell. “Chandler at some
          point docked him his wages for that week,” Redding recalled, “and he was never late again.”</p>

        <h4>Jimi Hendrix, Noel Redding, Mitch Mitchell</h4>

        <p>4. None of the album’s original songs were performed live by the Experience before they were recorded – and
          many were rehearsed for the first time right before the tape rolled. While most bands’ debut albums typically
          consist of original material honed over countless gigs, Hendrix preferred to teach his new songs to Redding
          and
          Mitchell right before they recorded them. “There were no rules on that stuff,” Mitchell remembered in a 1998
          interview.
          “There are many things that were just done in the studio, created in the studio, written in the studio, played
          once,
          and never played again – onstage or anywhere else.”</p>

        <p> The Experience’s uncanny ability to cook up a classic track on the spot is evidenced by “The Wind Cries
          Mary,”
          a Curtis Mayfield–influenced ballad that Hendrix had written shortly before the band’s recording session at De
          Lane Lea on January 11th, 1967. “That was recorded at the tail end of the session for ‘Fire,’ Chandler told
          McDermott. “We had about twenty minutes or so left. I suggested we cut a demo of ‘The Wind Cries Mary.’ Mitch
          Mitchell and Noel Redding hadn’t heard it, so they were going about it without a rehearsal. They played it
          once
          through [and Hendrix then suggested overdubs]. In all he put on four or five more overdubs, but the whole
          things
          was done in twenty minutes. That was our third single.”</p>

        <p>5. The Octavia pedal, an octave-doubling guitar effect, made its debut on “Purple Haze.”</p>

        <p>The opening track of the U.S. edition of Are You Experienced, “Purple Haze” was originally released as a U.K.
          single on March 17th, 1967. In addition to its radical mixture of blues, Eastern and psychedelic elements, the
          hard-rock anthem introduced the world to the Octavia, a new guitar effect that added a higher-octave overtone
          to
          each note of Hendrix’s guitar solos. Designed by English electronics whiz Roger Mayer – who had previously
          designed fuzz boxes for Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page – the effect would later be heard on such classic Hendrix
          tracks as
          “Fire,” “Little Wing” and “Machine Gun.” As a result, octave pedals became enormously popular with electric
          guitarists
          everywhere, with numerous manufacturers copying or building upon Mayer’s original design. At the time,
          however, the
          sounds it produced were considered unusual enough that, when Track Records sent the master tapes for “Purple
          Haze” to
          Reprise Records for remastering in the U.S., they felt compelled to include the following instructions:
          “Deliberate distortion. Do not correct.”</p>

        <p>6. “Purple Haze” isn’t really about an acid trip.
          Thanks to its lyrical themes of mental and physical disorientation (and the immortal line, “‘Scuse me while I
          kiss the sky”), “Purple Haze” is often thought to be a description of a psychedelic experience. But plenty of
          people close to Hendrix (including Noel Redding) believe that he hadn’t yet tried LSD when he wrote the song;
          and while Hendrix offered several conflicting explanations of the song’s lyrics to interviewers and
          colleagues,
          none of them had anything to do with drugs.</p>

        <p>“I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs,” he said in a January 1967 interview, while he was still
          working on the song. “I wrote one called ‘First Look Around the Corner’ and another called ‘The Purple Haze,’
          which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.” An avid science-fiction fan, Hendrix
          originally
          wrote a much longer version of the song, whose lyrics were partly inspired by an excerpt of Philip José
          Farmer’s
          sci-fi novel Night of Light: Day of Dreams, in which a “purplish haze” disorients and transforms the
          inhabitants
          of a distant planet.</p>

        <p>7. Hendrix hated the U.K. cover of Are You Experienced, and wanted the U.S. version to look more like a
          Hollies
          album cover. With its spherical fisheye image and strangely saturated colors, the U.S. cover of Are You
          Experienced remains
          one of the most iconic album covers of the psychedelic era. But it wouldn’t exist if Hendrix hadn’t absolutely
          loathed the cover of the earlier U.K. release, which featured a drab photo of the guitarist spreading a cape,
          Dracula-style, behind the heads of his bandmates.</p>

        <p>“He was not happy with its U.K. cover which, he said, ‘made him look like a fairy,'” recalled photographer
          Karl
          Ferris in 2008. Ferris had recently shot and designed the trippy cover of the Hollies’ Evolution LP, and
          Hendrix
          wanted something similar for his album’s U.S. release. Using a special fisheye lens and a self-invented
          “infrared” technique, Ferris (who also consulted on the band’s wardrobe and hairstyles for the shoot) shot the
          band against the leafy backdrop of London’s Kew Gardens. Hendrix was delighted with the results, telling
          Ferris,
          “You are the only photographer that is doing with photography what I am doing with music – knocking down the
          barriers and going far out beyond the limits.”</p>

        <h4>Jimi Hendrix Experience</h4>

        <p>8. “Hey Joe” and “Purple Haze” both stiffed as singles in the U.S.
          Though they were both Top 10 smashes in the U.K., neither “Hey Joe” nor “Purple Haze” found much favor with AM
          radio or pop consumers in the US. Released on May 1st, 1967 via Reprise Records, “Hey Joe” failed to even dent
          the U.S. singles charts, while “Purple Haze” – released June 19th, the day after Hendrix’s legendary
          performance
          at the Monterey Pop Festival – only made it to Number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, underground FM
          deejays in major markets like San Francisco and New York put both songs in steady rotation, which helped boost
          the sales of Are You Experienced considerably. Like many other Hendrix songs, they remain staples of
          classic-rock radio to this day.</p>

        <p>9. Are You Experienced was a hit with black listeners as well as white ones.
          Despite his deep blues and R&B roots, Hendrix received significantly more airplay from underground FM radio
          (which was primarily geared towards white rock fans) during his lifetime than he did from black radio
          stations,
          and he was often frustrated by accusations that he was pandering to a white audience. “Sometimes when I come
          up
          here [to Harlem], people say, ‘He plays white rock for white people, what’s he doing up here?'” he told the
          New
          York Times in August 1969. “I want to show them that music is universal – that there is no white rock or black
          rock.”</p>

        <p>But while his influence upon black music wouldn’t become apparent until the early Seventies – via acts like
          Funkadelic, the Ohio Players and the Isley Brothers, who drew heavily upon his freaky legacy – the
          oft-repeated
          claim that Hendrix didn’t have a black fan base during the late Sixties is far from correct. Are You
          Experienced
          not only peaked at Number Five on the Billboard 200 in the fall of 1967, but it also made it to Number 10 on
          the
          Billboard R&B chart, which was compiled from reports filed by record stores with a primarily black customer
          base. Hendrix would ultimately land five albums in the R&B Top 10, so it clearly wasn’t just white hippies who
          were buying his records.</p>

        <p>10. Rolling Stone gave the album a less-than-favorable write-up.
          Are You Experienced had already been out for two and a half months by the time the debut issue of Rolling
          Stone
          hit the streets. But since Hendrix’s success was one of the year’s biggest musical stories, Jon Landau offered
          his take on the album for the issue. His impressions were decidedly mixed.</p>

        <p>“Despite Jimi’s musical brilliance and the group’s total precision,” he wrote, “the poor quality of the songs
          and the inanity of the lyrics too often get in the way.” Though he praised the band’s instrumental virtuosity,
          Landau slammed their brash attack, concluding that “the sum total of all this is pure violence. Above all this
          record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that. Dig it if you can,” he
          concluded, “but as for me, I’d rather hear Jimi play the blues.”</p>

        <p>One of the greatest and most anticipated, unseen treasures in musical history will finally be
          revealed next month in London. The Jimi Hendrix Experience: The Royal Albert Hall, a feature-length film that
          documents the last European performance of the original line up of the Jimi Hendrix Experience will be
          screened to the public for the very first time since it was shot 50 years ago at the very location where it
          was primarily filmed: London’s historic Royal Albert Hall.</p>

        <p>The surprise announcement came from Experience Hendrix L.L.C. and The Last Experience, Inc. which have
          partnered on the event set for the evening of Monday, October 21. Experience Hendrix, headed by Janie Hendrix,
          is the family-owned company that administers the rights to recordings, performances and publishing associated
          with the late superstar. The Last Experience, Inc. is the production company, led by Jerry Goldstein, that
          originally partnered with Hendrix and documented the legendary performance on February 24, 1969.</p>

        <p>The Jimi Hendrix Experience: The Royal Albert Hall has long been considered the holy grail of ‘lost’ films.
          It has never before been released on any format nor commercially screened anywhere in the world. It has
          remained unseen and been the subject of death, litigation and intrigue since its creation fifty years ago.</p>

        <p>The film presents an extraordinary performance by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and also chronicles the hours
          leading up to the concert with the crew granted unprecedented access to Hendrix and his team throughout the
          day that preceded the performance, including backstage goings-on and a post-show reception. Producer Jerry
          Goldstein had the famed Royal Albert Hall theatrically lit as if it were a movie set, resulting in a richly
          detailed film free of the primitive concert lighting of the era and bizarre camera zooms and pans that poorly
          served other films from that era.</p>

        <p>This screening is a strict ‘One Night Only’ experience for fans as there are no current plans for a further
          release of the concert. Featuring a state-of-the-art sound system and giant screen, the show will be as close
          as you can get to seeing Hendrix perform on that prestigious stage 50 years ago.</p>

        <p>While stray clips have irregularly surfaced on various bootleg markets, over the years, the authorized
          version to be screened at the Royal Albert Hall has been meticulously restored with remastered sound and
          colour-corrected picture.</p>

        <p>To prepare the film for this unique anniversary event, Jerry Goldstein and Glenn Stone of The Last
          Experience, Inc. together with Janie Hendrix and John McDermott from Experience Hendrix painstakingly restored
          all of the original 16mm color film elements and prepared this feature length presentation. The film’s
          soundtrack was mixed by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix’s longtime recording engineer.</p>

        <p>The multiple 16mm cameras positioned throughout the Royal Albert Hall by Goldstein in 1969 documented many of
          the finest ever performances from Hendrix’s legendary career. Definitive versions of “Little Wing,” “Voodoo
          Child (Slight Return),” “Fire,” “Foxy Lady,” and “Stone Free”,” offer an unparalleled, enveloping audiovisual
          experience.</p>

        <p>The original concert is one the most legendary performances by Hendrix and the original iteration of the
          Experience. Chris Welch reviewed the show in Melody Maker one week later, writing, “When he broke into ‘Purple
          Haze’ feet pounded the hallowed floors, and whistles pierced the Victorian dome. The Hendrix electricity was
          still working, adding “the lengthy performance stretched his improvisational powers to the limit.”</p>

        <p>Jane Simmons discussed the sell-out audience’s reaction when the band initially left the stage: “The crowd
          then went absolutely berserk and shouted for more for about 4-5 minutes. Some people started to leave as it
          didn’t look as though they were coming back, but they did and then they went absolutely… ­ well, there is no
          word for it! People were dancing in the aisles. Jimi went mad with the atmosphere and they did Purple Haze and Wild
          Thing. He played with his teeth and then on the floor…. [the stage] was besieged by fans, police, bouncers,
          floor managers and practically the entire audience!’</p>

        <p>Janie Hendrix commented, “This has been a long time coming but we always had faith that things would work out
          and the public would see this film that documents Jimi Hendrix at the very peak of his powers. As those who
          are fortunate enough to see the showing next month at the very place where it was filmed will know, it has
          been well worth the wait and we are nothing short of delighted. The single word that springs to mind that
          describes this truly monumental development is ‘historic.’”</p>

        <p>Tickets are available from the Royal Albert Hall Box office on Friday 4 October. RAH Friends and Patrons

        <p>>Watch Songs Of Groovy Children album trailer: https://jimihendrix.lnk.to/groovyvid Over the course of four
          extraordinary years, Jimi Hendrix placed his indelible stamp upon popular music with breathtaking velocity.
          Measured alongside his triumphs at Monterey Pop and Woodstock, Hendrix’s legendary Fillmore East concerts
          illustrated a critical turning point in a radiant career filled with indefinite possibilities.</p>

        <p>The revolutionary impact Jimi Hendrix, Billy Cox and Buddy Miles had upon the boundaries and definitions of
          rock, R&B, and funk can be traced to four concerts over the course of two captivating evenings. These
          performances were first celebrated by Band of Gypsys, which featured six songs from the two January 1, 1970 concerts,
          including “Machine Gun,” the album’s dramatic centerpiece. Issued in April 1970, Band of Gypsys challenged and surprised
          the wide following of Jimi Hendrix with its extended arrangements and vibrant mix of rock and soul.</p>

        <p>In June of 1969, at the height of their fame, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, closed a musical chapter. Before
          the shockwaves could settle, Hendrix assembled a new, expanded ensemble to perform at Woodstock in August. A
          new chapter was opened as Hendrix introduced Gypsy Sun and Rainbows. The large ensemble included Jimi’s longtime
          friend Billy Cox, on bass, whom he had befriended when both were serving with the 101st Airborne Division in
          Ft. Campbell, Kentucky in 1962. This Woodstock lineup was short-lived; from its ashes a new trio emerged in
          October that Hendrix dubbed Band of Gypsys, consisting of Hendrix, Cox and Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles,
          who would also contribute occasional lead vocals. Hendrix was inspired by his collaboration with Cox and Miles and
          this creative renewal drove the development of promising new material such as “Power Of Soul,” “Burning Desire” and
          the extraordinary “Machine Gun.”</p>

        <p>Their debut live performances were a series of four concerts at the Fillmore East in Manhattan – two on New
          Year’s Eve 1969 and two on New Year’s Day 1970, each of which were professionally recorded. Hendrix had sold
          out Madison Square Garden just nine months prior, but the Fillmore East was chosen as the setting for a live
          recording. Long before his fame, Hendrix had signed what he thought was a release for appearing as a studio musician 
          in October 1965. Unfortunately, the one page artist agreement drafted by PPX Industries bound his services for a
          period of three years. Unwilling to live hands tied, Hendrix agreed to a 1968 legal settlement whereby Capitol
          Records would be granted the distribution rights for his next album. By the autumn of 1969, Capitol and PPX were
          pushing hard for the album delivery and Hendrix decided to give them a live album.</p>

        <p>However stressful this legal obligation had been for the guitarist, the end result proved to be an artistic
          triumph. True to his unpredictability, Hendrix opened his four-show stint with a masterful, eleven song set
          that did not feature a single song he had commercially released. Exciting new songs such as “Izabella,” “Ezy
          Ryder” and “Burning Desire” thrilled the sold-out house. Hendrix would pepper the remaining three shows with
          supercharged reworkings of favorites such as “Stone Free,” “Purple Haze,” and “Fire” but these were presented 
          alongside such devastating, newly developed fare as “Machine Gun.” In his review of the second New Year’s Eve concert,
          Down Beat critic Chris Albertson wrote, “That ability of his to utilize fully the technical possibilities of his
          instrument, combined with his fertile musical imagination, makes him an outstanding performer.”</p>

        <p>By the end of January 1970, the band was history, but the blend of funk, rock and soul pioneered by the trio
          became history, making a profound impact on popular music in its wake. Notable devotees include funk pioneers
          Parliament-Funkadelic, Curtis Mayfield, the Isley Brothers (with whom Hendrix himself had at one time played)
          and Bootsy Collins, extending all the way forward to hip-hop. Countless artists cite the record as a
          cornerstone in their appreciation of Jimi Hendrix ’s remarkable abilities.</p>

        <p>The original 1970 Band of Gypsys album was edited and sequenced from songs performed during the two Fillmore
          sets on January 1, 1970. Subsequent collections mined more material from each of the performances with
          significant chunks of these phenomenal recordings from those nights sitting unreleased for almost half a century. 
          Newly mixed and restored in sequence without edits, fans can finally hear Hendrix, Cox and Miles blast through their
          genre-defying sets that included freshly written songs like “Earth Blues” and “Stepping Stone,” as well as
          Experience favorites inclusive of “Foxey Lady,” “Voodoo Child (Slight Return),” “Wild Thing,” “Hey Joe” and
          “Purple Haze.” Additionally, exciting new versions of Howard Tate’s “Stop,” “Steal Away,” by Jimmy Hughes and
          a searing “Bleeding Heart” by Elmore James highlighted the command that the trio had over blues & R&B music.

        <p>The lavish package is filled with unseen photos from talent such as Fillmore East house photographer Amalie
          Rothschild, Jan Blom (whose iconic, color saturated images provided the original artwork for 1970’s Band of
          Gypsys) as well as Marshall Amplifier representative Marc Franklin, who had full access to the group in their
          dressing room backstage. The booklet features remembrances from bassist Billy Cox and liner notes by
          author/journalist/filmmaker Nelson George. Songs For Groovy Children was produced by Janie Hendrix, Eddie
          Kramer and John McDermott – the trio that has overseen every project for Experience Hendrix since 1995. The
          box set was mastered by Grammy-winning engineer Bernie Grundman.</p>

        <p>Kicking off today at the Paramount Theatre in Jimi’s hometown of Seattle, WA is the fall leg of the
          Experience Hendrix Tour, the acclaimed multi-artist celebration of Jimi Hendrix’s musical genius. The trek
          winds its way down the west coast into Oregon, California, Nevada, and then heading eastward into Arizona, Colorado,
          Oklahoma and Texas, culminating in San Antonio Oct. 22. Participants include blues legend Buddy Guy, best-selling
          instrumental rock guitarist Joe Satriani,Taj Mahal, Dweezil Zappa, Jonny Lang, Eric Johnson and Billy Cox. His
          has, arguably, the longest lasting musical relationship with Jimi Hendrix, spanning their time in the U.S. Army,
          performance in Nashville-based soul combos and with Band of Gypsys, and continuing with the Tribute Concert Tours in 
          honor of the legacy of Jimi Hendrix to the present day.</p>
