          <span id="Bio-header">Jimi Hendrix Biography</span><br>
          Born in 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi Hendrix learned to play guitar as a teenager and grew up to become
          a rock legend who excited audiences in the 1960s with his innovative electric guitar playing. One of his most
          memorable performances was at Woodstock in 1969, where he performed "The Star Spangled Banner." Hendrix died
          in 1970 from drug-related complications, leaving his mark on the world of rock music and remaining popular to
          this day.<br>

          <div class="Mobile-Noshow d-none d-md-block">
            <br><span id="Bio-header">Early Years</span><br>
            Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix (later changed by his father to James Marshall) on November 27,
            1942, in Seattle, Washington. He had a difficult childhood, sometimes living in the care of relatives or
            acquaintances.
            His mother, Lucille, was only 17 years old when Hendrix was born. She had a stormy relationship with his
            father, Al, and eventually left the family after the couple had two more children together, sons Leon and
            Joseph. Hendrix would only see his mother sporadically before her death in 1958.<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">Jimi Hendrix Guitar</span><br>
            In many ways, music became a sanctuary for Hendrix. He was a fan of blues and rock and roll, and with his
            father's encouragement taught himself to play guitar.
            When Hendrix was 16, his father bought him his first acoustic guitar, and the next year his first electric
            guitar—a right-handed Supro Ozark that the natural lefty had to flip upside down to play. Shortly
            thereafter,
            he began performing with his band, the Rocking Kings. In 1959, he dropped out of high school and worked odd
            jobs while continuing to follow his musical aspirations.
            In 1961, Hendrix followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the United States Army. While training
            as
            a paratrooper, Hendrix still found time for music, forming a band named the King Kasuals. Hendrix served in
            the army until 1962, when he was honorably discharged after injuring himself during a parachute jump.
            After leaving the military, Hendrix began working under the name Jimmy James as a session musician, playing
            backup for such performers as Little Richard, B.B. King, Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers. In 1965 he also
            formed a group of his own called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which played gigs around New York City's
            Greenwich Village neighborhood.<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">Jimi Hendrix Experience</span><br>
            In mid-1966, Hendrix met Chas Chandler—bass player of British rock group the Animals—who signed an agreement
            with Hendrix to become his manager. Chandler convinced Hendrix to go to London, where he joined forces with
            bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
            While performing in England, Hendrix built up quite a following among the country's rock royalty, with the
            Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and Eric Clapton all becoming great admirers of his work. One critic
            for
            the British music magazine Melody Maker said that he "had great stage presence" and looked at times as if he
            were playing "with no hands at all."<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">Jimi Hendrix Hey Joe</span><br>
            Released in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, "Hey Joe," was an instant smash in Britain and
            was soon followed by hits such as "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary."
            On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967), Hendrix delighted audiences with his
            outrageous guitar playing skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over
            American music fans with his stunning performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix
            lighting his guitar on fire.<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">Electric Ladyland</span><br>
            Quickly becoming a rock superstar, later that year Hendrix scored again with his second album, Axis: Bold as
            Love (1967).
            His final album as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Electric Ladyland (1968), featured the hit "All
            Along
            the Watchtower," which was written by Bob Dylan. The band continued to tour until it split up in 1969.<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">Star-Spangled Banner</span><br>
            In 1969, Hendrix performed at another legendary musical event: the Woodstock Festival.
            Hendrix, the last performer to appear in the three-day-plus festival, opened his set with a rock rendition
            of
            "The Star-Spangled Banner" that amazed the crowds and demonstrated his considerable talents as a musician.
            Also an accomplished songwriter and producer by this time, Hendrix had his own recording studio, Electric
            Lady, in which he worked with different performers to try out new songs and sounds.
            In late 1969, Hendrix put together a new group, forming Band of Gypsys with his army buddy Billy Cox and
            drummer Buddy Miles. The band never really took off, however, and Hendrix began working on a new album
            tentatively named First Rays of the New Rising Sun, with Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Sadly, Hendrix would not
            live
            to complete the project.<br>

            <br><span id="Bio-header">How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?</span><br>
            Jimi Hendrix died in London from drug-related complications on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27. He left
            an indelible mark on the world of rock music and remains popular to this day.
            As one journalist wrote in the Berkeley Tribe, "Jimi Hendrix could get more out of an electric guitar than
            anyone else. He was the ultimate guitar player."<br>

          improved on. And there's the spirit that goes into it. He creates a place where you can be high and hang out
          and lose yourself. He's bringing out aspects of sound we didn't know were there. I feel there are people
          moving ahead on that front, but they're not so much guitar players — like [electronic artists] Aphex Twin and

          ELECTRIC CHURCH tells the story of the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s involvement as the headliner of the Second
          Atlanta International Pop Festival, then hailed as the ‘Southern Woodstock'.
          Jimi Hendrix was the critical component he needed to elevate the three day festival to a major cultural event.
          ELECTRIC CHURCH features interviews with Hendrix’s Experience band mates Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell
          as well as Paul McCartney, Steve Winwood, Rich Robinson, Kirk Hammett, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, and many
          others.
          His performance at the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival was not only significant on a musical level,
          but also in terms of socio-political dynamics. It was assumed that rural audiences would not take kindly to
          “long-hair” bands, and that black and white artists could not comfortably exist on the same bill; Atlanta Pop
          set out to challenge those beliefs.
          Hendrix’s music and message of universal love made him the ideal artist and, appropriately, was the first act
          booked for the festival. Footage has remained largely unseen until now.
